Is it possible that She will have me forgiven for ambitions continuously crushed,--
<br>
that an affluent end will make up for the ages of indigence --
<br>
that a day of success will lull us to sleep on the shame of out fatal incompetence?
<br>
(O palms! diamond!-- Love! strength!-- higher than all joys and all fame!--
<br>
in any case, everywhere-- demon, god,-- Youth of this being myself!)
<br>
That the accidents of scientific wonders and the movements of social brotherhood
<br>
will be cherished as the progressive restitution of our original freedom?...
<br>
But the Vampire who makes us behave orders us to enjoy ourselves
<br>
with what she leaves us, or in other words to be more amusing.
<br>
Rolled in our wounds through the wearing air and the sea;
<br>
in torments through the silence of the murderous waters and air;
<br>
in tortures that laugh in the terrible surge of their silence.
